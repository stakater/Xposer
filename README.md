# ![](assets/web/xposer-round-100px.png) Xposer

## Problem
We would like to watch for services running in our cluster; and create Ingresses and generate TLS certificates automatically

## Solution

Xposer can watch for all the services running in our cluster; Creates, Updates, Deletes Ingresses and uses certmanager to generate TLS certificates automatically based on some annotations.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

### Vanialla Manifests

You have to first clone or download the repository contents. The kubernetes deployment and files are provided inside deployments/kubernetes/manifests folder

### Helm Charts

Alternatively if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add Xposer to helm from our public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

```
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts

helm repo update

helm install stakater/xposer
```

## How to use Xposer

### Config
The default config of Xposer is located at /configs/config.yaml

```
domain: stakater.com
ingressURLTemplate: "{{.Service}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}"
ingressURLPath: /
ingressNameTemplate: "{{.Service}}"
tls: false
```

Each property is explained below in details

For Xposer to  work on your service, it must have a label "expose = true"

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
```

### Kubernetes

#### Ingresses

Xposer reads the following annotations from a service
```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
       firstAnnotation : abc
       secondAnnotation: abc
       thirdAnnotation: abc
```
xposer.stakater.com/annotations accepts annotations in new line. All the annotations provided here will be forwarded to Ingress as it is.

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressNameTemplate: "{{.Service}}-{{.Namespace}}"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLTemplate: "{{.Service}}.{{.Domain}}"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLPath: "/"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain: domain.com
    config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: "true"
```
The above 5 annotations are used to generate Ingress, if not provided default annotations from /configs/config.yaml will be used. 3 variables used are:
1. {{.Service}} = Name of the service which is created/updated
2. {{.Namespace}} = Namespace in which Xposer is running
3. {{.Domain}} = Default domain from /configs/config.yaml file. Can be changed there.

The above 5 annotations are for the following purpose:

1. config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressNameTemplate: With this annotation we can templatize generated Ingress Name. We can use the following template variables as well {{.Service}}, {{.Namespace}}. Can not include domain in Ingress name.

2. config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLTemplate: With this annotation we can templatize generated Ingress URL/Hostname. We can use all 3 variables to templatize it

3. config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLPath: With this annotation we can specify Ingress Path

4. config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain: With this annotation we can specify domain

5. config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: With this annotation we can specify wether to use certmanager and generate a TLS certificate or not

#### Certmanager

First of all you need to install certmanager, and a Issuer/ClusterIssuer in your cluster. Xposer only needs 2 annotations to generate TLS certificates

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
       certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: your-cluster-issuer-name
    config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: "true"
```
The above example use cluster issuer "certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer:" annotation which will be forwaded to the ingress as it is with the installed issuer/cluster issuer name. 

The second annotation "config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS:" tells Xposer to add TLS information to the Ingress so it can communicate with the certmanager to generate certificates

### Openshift

Support for openshift routes will be added soon
